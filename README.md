# CADGallery



CADGallery is a place for engineers to show off and discuss their 3D design portfolios. Seed content and styling are taken from Autodesk Gallery. Engineers and Architects can upload their projects and ask fellow designers questions about their projects. When supported CAD files are uploaded, users can manipulate them in 3D right in the browser.
